# 🛒 **Superstore Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard**  
> ##### Includes custom Python preprocessing (EDA, feature engineering), and DAX measures for advanced interactivity.
> ##### The dataset contains 9800+ rows of sales transactions from a global office supplies retailer, including fields for region, category, sub-category, dates, sales, profit, discount and customer info.
> ##### Data used was taken from the [Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

## 📊 ***Overview:***
In this project, I explored Superstore sales data to uncover patterns across products, customers, time, and shipping operations.  
I designed a **5-page Power BI dashboard** that provides actionable business insights for sales and operations teams.  
This suite supports performance monitoring, segmentation, and strategic decision-making.

## 🔧 ***Tools Used:***
  - **Power BI**  
  - **DAX** (TopN logic, conditional formatting, custom KPIs)  
  - **Python (Pandas, EDA)** - Data cleaning and feature engineering 
  - **Data Modeling**
  - **Data Visualization & Storytelling**

## 📈 ***Dashboard Highlights:***  
  
### 🧾 **KPI Cards:**  
  - **Total Sales**, **Orders** and **Customers**  
  - **Avg Sales per Order** and **Avg Sales per Customer**  
  - **Top Products**, **Customers**, **Regions** and **Ship Modes**   
  - **Best and Worst Months by Sales**
  
### 🧪 **Filters & Slicers:**  
  - Product Category & Sub-Category  
  - Segment, Region, State, City
  - Year, Month
  
### 📊 **Pages & Visuals:**  
  
#### _**Page 1 - Executive Overview**_
  - Sales trends across time
  - Revenue, Total Orders and Customer base
  - Regional Performance
  - Category and Segment breakdowns

#### _**Page 2 - Time Trends**_
  - Year-over-Year Sales comparison
  - Segment & Category Sales over time
  - Best and Worst Months identified by DAX logic

#### _**Page 3 - Product Segmentation**_
  - Most Sold Product, Category and Sub-Category
  - **Tree Map**: Top 10 Products
  - Sales distribution by Category and Sub-Category

#### _**Page 4 - Customer Segmentation**_
  - Customer Loyalty (Orders vs Spend)
  - Top Customers by Revenue
  - Distribution by Segment and Region
  - Geographic map of Customer spread

#### _**Page 5 - Shipping Analysis**_
  - Most Used and Fastest Shipping modes
  - Avg Shipping time by DAX
  - Regional distribution of Ship Modes
  - Sales trends by shipping method
  - **Heatmap**: Ship Mode x Segment Usage
  
## 🎯 ***Key Features:***
  - 25+ custom **DAX measures** and **KPIs**
  - **Dynamic drilldowns** via slicers and filters
  - **Enhanced tooltips** with deep metric context
  - **Python-based cleaning and feature creation**
  - **Interactive dashboards** with minimal clutter and maximum insight
  - Balanced design for **executive readability + analyst exploration**

## 💡 ***Key Insights:***
  - **November is consistently the best-performing month** for sales across multiple years.
  - **Standard Class is the most used Ship Mode**, but **Same Day is the fastest** and underutilized.
  - **Binders**, **Paper**, **Furnishings** and **Phones** are top-performing Sub-Categories.
  - The **West Region** dominates in both sales and order volume.
  - **Technology Category** yields higher average order sales despite fewer customers.

## 🧠 ***Business Value***
This dashboard suite enables:
  - **Sales performance monitoring**
  - **Customer behavior analysis**
  - **Product performance comparison**
  - **Shipping efficiency evaluation**
