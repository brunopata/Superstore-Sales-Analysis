### ðŸ“Š *Overview:*
In this project, I explored Superstore sales data to uncover patterns across products, customers, time and shipping operations.  
I designed a 5-page Power BI dashboard that provides actionable business insights for sales and operations teams. This suite supports performance monitoring, segmentation and strategic decision-making.

### ðŸ”§ ***Tools Used:***
- **Power BI**  
- **DAX** (TopN logic, conditional formatting, custom KPIs)  
- **Python** (Pandas) â€“ for data cleaning and feature engineering  
- **Data Modeling**
- **Data Visualization & Business Storytelling**

### ðŸ“ˆ ***Dashboard Highlights:***
- **KPI Cards:**  
  - **Total Sales**, **Orders** and **Customers**
  - **Avg Sales per Order** and **Avg Sales per Customer**
- **Filters & Slicers:**  
  - Gender, Age, Department, Overtime, Satisfaction Levels, etc...  
- **Key Visuals:**  
  - Attrition by Department, Role, Tenure  
  - Job Satisfaction vs. Years at Company
  - Overtime trends and Work/Life Balance Impact
  
### ðŸŽ¯ *Key Features:*
- Overall attrition KPIs and department-level breakdowns  
- Drill-downs by Role, Tenure, Satisfaction and Overtime status  
- Interactive slicers to explore Gender, Age, Education and more  
- Trend visualizations and detailed tooltips for deeper insights
  
### ðŸ§  *Key Insights:*
- Employees that work Overtime are more likely to leave.
- Satisfaction scores (Job, Environment, Work/Life Balance) strongly correlate with attrition.
- Sales show the highest turnover rates.
- R&D roles show the highest turnover count.
- Tenure shows higher attrition below 1 year.
